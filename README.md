> Minimal (s)css framework with a focus on variables

Based on [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)'s variable file

## Todo
- .l .t .b. .r with -#{spacer} for absolutely positioned elements


- Potentially make it opinionated, and before setting the colors to their hover variables, etc; set the base color to have a hue-lightness of 50%
